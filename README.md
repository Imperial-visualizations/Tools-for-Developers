# Tools-for-Developers

A collection of tutorials, examples, and guidelines for developers working at Imperial Visualisations.

First have a readthrough the 'Welcome to the Imperial Visualisations Community' document. This will tell you about the overall structure and process of Imperial Visualisations, and gives you links to our slack, github, and trello.

The ‘Tutorials’ document outlines recommended resources to help a new developer learn HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Plotly, and Jquery/p5.js.
