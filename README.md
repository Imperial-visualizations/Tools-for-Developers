# Tools-for-Developers

A collection of tutorials, examples, and guidelines for developers working at Imperial Visualisations. 

First have a readthrough the 'Welcome to the Imperial Visualisations Community' document. This will tell you about the overall structure and process of Imperial Visualisations, and gives you links to our slack, github, and trello.

For a very first visualisation template, download the 'basic template' folder. If you are looking for more advanced template code, download the 'advanced template' folder. To inspect an example visualisation's code, refer to the 'example' folder.

The 'guidelines' documents give detailed explanations, tips, and advice on three distinct topics: coding up the functionality of the visualisation, the visual style of our visualisations, and designing the learning experience of the visualisations.

Do get in touch via Slack if you have any questions. Enjoy :)
